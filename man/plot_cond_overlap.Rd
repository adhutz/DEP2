\title{Plot conditions overlap}
\usage{
plot_cond_overlap(dep, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{SummarizedExperiment,
Data object for which differentially enriched proteins are annotated
(output from \code{\link{test_diff}()} and \code{\link{add_rejections}()}).}

\item{plot}{Logical(1),
If \code{TRUE} (default) the barplot is produced.
Otherwise (if \code{FALSE}), the data which the
barplot is based on are returned.}
}
\value{
A histogram (generated by \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}})
}
\description{
\code{plot_cond_overlap} generates a histogram of
the number of proteins per condition or overlapping conditions.
