\arguments{
\item{enriched_peptide}{The SummarizedExperiment object of modified-relative proteomics.}

\item{relative_protein}{The SummarizedExperiment object of the relative global proteomics}

\item{correct_key}{The key identifier column to match PTM peptides and proteins, one of "name", "ID"}

\item{correct_level}{Character(1), how to match experiment design, should be one of "condition" or "replicate"}

unidentified in the relative global proteomics}
}
\value{
A modified-relative proteomics SummarizedExperiment object with adjusted quantities
}
\description{
Adjust modified-enrich peptide quantities (PTM relative proteomics) by a relative global proteomics data via matching
\code{correct_key} and \code{correct_level}
}
