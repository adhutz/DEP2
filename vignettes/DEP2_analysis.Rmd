# Introduction

`DEP2` provides a differentially expressed/enriched analysis toolkit for mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics data via `limma` [@Ritchie:2015], upgraded from a previous package `r Biocpkg("DEP")` [@Zhang:2018]. This package provides an integrated workflow for proteomics analysis, including data processing, missing value imputation, hypothesis test, visualization and downstream function exploration. It accepts various of proteomics results generated by upstream search and quantitative software and provides function to format table.

Now, `DEP2` provide three types of differential proteomics analysis:

1.  The pipeline for proteins-level expression/enrichment analysis, started from protein-level quantity.

    This pipeline is basically follows the methods in `DEP`, requires a protein-level quantity result (e.g. proteingroups.txt).

2.  The pipeline for proteins-level expression/enrichment analysis, started from peptide-level quantity.

    This pipeline clustered the peptide to protein summarization strategies in `QFeatures`, requires a protein-level quantity (e.g. peptide.txt).

3.  The pipeline for post-translation modification (PTM) specified proteomics, performed upon modified peptides quantity.

    This ppipline derived from the first one, and concludes the additional modification information in analysis.

Besides, DEP2 cluster downstream exploration analyses into workflow, including: functional enrichment provided by `r Biocpkg("clusterProfiler")` [@Wu:2021] and `r Biocpkg("ReactomePA")``; protein-protein interaction inference from STRING database; and time-course expression pattern clustering though cmeans cluster. As an optional function, DEP2 also packaged a RNA-seq data analysis pipeline.

# Install

Now, DEP2 is available at GitHub and can be installed via
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mildpiggy/DEP2")
```

DEP2 cluster downstream functions for biological interpretation. Such additional functions 
depend on some suggest packages which would not be installed when install DEP2. You can complete the functions though following.

```{r install depends, eval=FALSE}
library(DEP2)

## required packages for enrichment analysis
DEP2::check_enrichment_depends(install = TRUE)

## Anotation OrgDb for human. 
## Other orgnism is also , orgnism can be one of "Human", "Mouse", "Fly", "Rat", "Yeast" and et al.
DEP2::check_organismDB_depends(organism = "Human",install = TRUE)

## required packages for PPI analysis
DEP2::check_PPI_depends(install = TRUE)

## required packages for RNA-seq analysis
DEP2::check_RNAseq_depends(install = TRUE)
```

Besides, DEP2 perform a PPI based on a local database downloaded from *STRING*. 
If it is absent in the first run, `load_PPIdata` will automatically download from https://stringdb-static.org/download/, 
and. If the local database is exist, `load_PPIdata` will directly load it.
```{r load PPI, eval=TRUE,message=TRUE}
if(DEP2::check_PPI_depends()){
  load_PPIdata(speciesname = "Mouse") 
  # The download database is saved in `system.file("PPIdata", "Mouse",package = "DEP2")`
}
```

# Input data

`DEP2` requires wide result table, and formats the identifiers (gene name and protein id in general) by `make_unique()` or `make_unique_ptm()`. Here we will use the omcis results of a silicosis study [@Wang:2022] as the example data to demonstrate the usage of `DEP2`. In the research, authors implemented global proteome, phosphoproteome and transcriptome on a mouse model.

## Load protein-level data

Read in a proteingroup table (e.g. the quantitative result table from MaxQuant), then format the identifiers of each proteingroups though `make_unique`. *names* and *ids* are formatted to ensure identifiers are unique in table. 

```{r readin,collapse=T}
## a proteinGroups data of a silicosis mouse model
data(Silicosis_pg) 
# str(Silicosis_pg) # check the table

## Formatting name(gene symbol) and id(protein ID). 
## Generate a unique names for each protein. names and ids are columns in table
unique_pg <- make_unique(Silicosis_pg, names = "Gene.names", 
                         ids = "Protein.IDs", delim = ";") 

## The duplicated names are uniqued by increasing decimal number after original names.
unique_pg %>% filter(Gene.names!="") %>% group_by(Gene.names) %>% summarize(frequency = n(), names = paste0(name,collapse = ";")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) %>% filter(frequency > 1) %>% head
```


Build a SummarizedExperiment object. DEP2 still use `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` container as the analysis container to store expression assay, features information (row data) and experiment design (columns data). Experiment design that label sample information is optional in workflow. DEP/DEP2 can accept a experiment design table contains 'label', 'condition' and 'replicate', or automatically assign it by parsing abundance assay column names.

```{r SE,collapse=T}
## Take expression columns(LFQ intensity in this cases).
ecols <- grep("LFQ.intensity.", colnames(unique_pg))

## Construct SE
### 1. import a experiment design table.
data(Silicosis_ExpDesign)
expdesign <- Silicosis_ExpDesign
head(expdesign, 6) # the example experiment design

se_pg <- DEP2::make_se(unique_pg, columns = ecols, expdesign = expdesign, 
                       log2transform = T)
class(se_pg)
head(assay(se_pg), 5) ## log2-transformed expression assay 

### 2. Generate a experiment design by parsing expression column names.
se_pg2 <- DEP2::make_se_parse(unique_pg, columns = ecols, mode = "delim", 
                              sep = "_", remove_prefix = T, log2transform = T)
head(colData(se_pg2), 6)
```

## Load peptide quantification result for protein aggregation

The second pipeline is to calculate protein-level abundance by peptide summarization. It can bypass the summarization method in the upstream software. DEP2 draw the protein aggregation though the `r Biocpkg("QFeatures")` [@Gatto:2020], and use the `QFeatures` container to process peptide-level data. This pipeline requires a peptide result table contains both abundance assay and relative protein information (gene names or protein ID) for protein aggregation.

```{r readinpep,collapse=T}
## a peptides table from a silicosis mouse model.
data(Silicosis_peptide) 

## Here we just select two groups to save computational cost in these vignette
(ecols <- grep("Intensity.PBS|Intensity.W4", colnames(Silicosis_peptide), value = T)) 
pe_peptides <- make_pe_parse(Silicosis_peptide, columns = ecols,   # columns is the abundance columns
                             mode = "delim", sep = "_",
                             remove_prefix = T, log2transform = T) # log2transform 
pe_peptides # a QFeatures object, with a peptideRaw assay
colData(pe_peptides)
```


In some cases, upstream quantitative software may export a long_format result table. DEP2 provide a format transform function `reshape_long2wide` to transform long table to wide table containing the expression assay which rows is feature(protein, peptide or precursor), and columns are sample quantitative results or identical information. Long table can be firstly reshaped to wide table.

```{r readinwide,collapse=T}
# A example long result table
long_table <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/DIA-NN_Export.tsv.gz",package = "DEP2"),sep = "\t")
head(long_table[,c("Precursor.Id","File.Name","Precursor.Normalised")],5)

# Filter on result table
long_table <- filter(long_table, Q.Value < 0.01)

# Reshape to a wide expression table, and remove prefix and suffix of sample column
wide_table <- reshape_long2wide(long_table,sample_col = "File.Name",
                                 feature_col = "Precursor.Id", expression_col = "Precursor.Normalised",
                                 remove_sample_prefix = T, remove_sample_suffix = T)
head(wide_table,3)

# Keep some identification information
wide_table2 <- reshape_long2wide(long_table,sample_col = "File.Name",
                                 feature_col = "Precursor.Id", expression_col = "Precursor.Normalised",
                                 shrink_ident_cols = c("Protein.Names","Protein.Group",
                                                       "Stripped.Sequence","Modified.Sequence",
                                                       "Precursor.Charge","Evidence"),
                                 extend_ident_cols = "Q.Value",
                                 remove_sample_prefix = T, remove_sample_suffix = T)
# shrink_ident_cols will save the unique value of each feature (like "Protein.Names") or 
# paste a character string of all values of a feature (like "Precursor.Charge" and "Evidence").
# extend_ident_cols will be extend to a widt-format containing the values in every sample (like "Q.Value").
head(wide_table2, 2)

pe_peptides2 <- make_pe_parse(wide_table2, columns = 2:7,   # columns is the abundance columns
                              mode = "delim", sep = "_inj",
                              remove_prefix = T, log2transform = T)
colData(pe_peptides2)

```


## Load the modified-site quantification result to perform differetial PTM analysis.

For, PTM-specific proteomics study, DEP2 designs a new workflow similar from global proteomics analysis. In this pipeline, post-translation modification information is necessary to distinguish modified sites. This pipeline required the unique identifier for distinguish different modified sites, modification information such as position, modified residue(amino acid), gene name or protein ID that modification is associated with.

```{r readinpho}
## phosphorylated peptides table of the silicosis mouse model.
data(Silicosis_phos) 

## Format the modification information and generated modified-peptides identifier.
## aa and pos is the modified amino acids and modified site in protein.
unique_pho <- make_unique_ptm(Silicosis_phos, gene_name = "Gene.names", 
                              protein_ID = "Protein", aa = "Amino.acid",
                              pos = "Position") 
```

`make_unique_ptm` creates(or overwrites) the PTM information columns, including *name*, *ID*, *gene_name*, *protein_ID*, *modified_aa*, *modified_pos*. The *name*, *ID* columns follow such naming rule： '(gene name/protein ID)_(modified amino acid)(position of modification)' (e.g. "TBCA_K51" and "O75347_K51").

```{r readinpho2}
## The formatted name and ID for PTM
unique_pho %>% select("name","ID","gene_name","protein_ID","modified_aa","modified_pos") %>% head(7)

## Take expression columns.
ecols <- grep("Intensity.", colnames(unique_pho))

## Construct a SE object mentioned before.
se_ptm <- DEP2::make_se_parse(unique_pho, columns = ecols, mode = "delim", sep = "_", remove_prefix = T, log2transform = T)
```

# Differentially expression analysis

DEP2 provide an entire workflow for each pipeline. Such

## Analysis for proteomics data

![](figs/DEP2workflow1.png "Fig. 1 Pepline for proteingroups")

**Filter**

Undesired features, like reverse sequences or contaminant protein hits, may contain in the result table. Besides, missing values (MVs) is inevasible label-free MS-based proteomics especially for DDA data. Filter out reverse, contaminant, and low quality features with many missing is required for following statistical test. `filter_se` can filter features based on missing threshold or criterion on giving information.

```{r filter pg, collapse=T}
filter_pg <- filter_se(se_pg,
                       thr = 1,  ## the threshold of missing number in at least one condition
                       fraction = 0.3, ## the threshold of missing occupancy in each protein
                       filter_formula = ~ Reverse != '+' & Potential.contaminant !="+" ## filter upon Reverse and contaminant
                      )
## Further filter can perform though filter_formula.
## For example, keep proteingroups with at least one unique peptide in further analysis.
filter_pg <- filter_se(filter_pg,
                       filter_formula = ~ Unique.peptides > 0)

get_df_wide(se_pg)$Reverse %>% table
get_df_wide(filter_pg)$Reverse %>% table

(plot_coverage(se_pg) + ggtitle("Before filter")) + 
  (plot_coverage(filter_pg) + ggtitle("After filter"))

(plot_frequency(se_pg) + ggtitle("Identification overlap before filter")) / 
  (plot_frequency(filter_pg) + ggtitle("Identification overlap after before filter"))
```

**Normalization**

Assay should be log2-transformed during SE construction. In the DEP and DEP2 workflow, proteingroup assay is further normalized by variance stabilizing transformation(vsn).

```{r message=FALSE}
norm_pg <- normalize_vsn(filter_pg)
plot_normalization(filter_pg, norm_pg)
```

**imputation**

A considerable proportion of remaining MVs still remain in the assay after filtering.

```{r missing heatmap, message=FALSE}
plot_missval(filter_pg)
```

MVs can be divided into missing at random (MAR), missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR), based on NA frequency intensity signal. Function `impute` draws kinds of imputation on SE object. Be same as DEP, `impute` cluster the imputation functions from `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` and `r Biocpkg("MsCoreUtils")`, including following methods.

-- Left-censored imputation methods, replace: *"MinDet", "MinProb", "min"(LOD), "QRILC", "zero", "man"(impute by a left-shifted distribution)*

-- local similarity methods: *"knn", "nbavg"*

-- Global-structure methods: *"MLE", "BPCA"*

Further detials can view the vignettes in `r Biocpkg("DEP")` and `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")`. In additional, DEP2 clusters two machine learning based imputation in `impute`: *"RF"* and *"GSimp"*. "RF" call the `missForest::missForest`, which train a random forest based on observed parts of dataset. And "GSimp" is a Gibbs sampler based left-censored imputation method proposed by [Runmin Wei, Jingye Wang, etc](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.%20pcbi.1005973). These two methods take a long time on iteration but are reported that could draw a better estimation on missing.

```{r impute, collapse=T}
set.seed(35)
sample_rows <- sample(1:nrow(norm_pg), 300)
norm_pg_sample = norm_pg[sample_rows,] # random sample 150 features to reduce runing time
plot_detect(norm_pg_sample)

## Impute missing data using random draws from a Gaussian distribution centered around a minimal value (for MNAR)
imp_pg_MinProb <- DEP2::impute(norm_pg_sample, fun = "MinProb", q = 0.01)

## Impute missing data using k-nearest neighbour approach
imp_pg_knn <- DEP2::impute(norm_pg_sample, fun = "knn")

## Impute missing data using missForest
imp_pg_RF <- DEP2::impute(norm_pg_sample, fun = "RF", ntree = 50, mtry = 5) 

## Impute missing data using Gibbs
imp_pg_GSimp <- DEP2::impute(norm_pg_sample, fun = "GSimp", hi_q = 0.1,
                       iters_each=40, iters_all=8)

## Impute missing data using QRILC
imp_pg_QRILC <- DEP2::impute(norm_pg_sample, fun = "QRILC") 
```

The distribution of mean intensity of missing or non-missing proteingroups

```{r message=FALSE}
plot_detect(norm_pg_sample)
```
The difference among imputation methods.
```{r compare imp}
NAs <- is.na(assay(norm_pg_sample)) 
## the imputed values by different methods.
imps <- list("GSimp" = imp_pg_GSimp, "QRILC" = imp_pg_QRILC, "MinProb" = imp_pg_MinProb, "RF" = imp_pg_RF, "knn" = imp_pg_knn) %>% 
  lapply(function(se){
    x = assay(se) %>% data.frame %>% gather("label", "value") %>% 
      left_join(colData(se)[c("label","condition")],copy = T) %>%
      magrittr::extract(as.vector(NAs),)
  }) %>% data.table::rbindlist(idcol = "method")

## the original normalized values without imputation
nonimps <- assay(norm_pg_sample) %>% data.frame %>% gather("label", "value") %>%
  left_join(colData(norm_pg_sample)[c("label","condition")],copy = T) %>% 
  magrittr::extract(!as.vector(NAs),) %>% mutate(method = "non_impute") %>%
  select(method,everything())

library(ggridges)
ggplot(rbind(imps, nonimps),aes(x = value,y = factor(method,level = unique(method)))) + 
  geom_density_ridges(fill = "#027ad450", scale = 1.2,
                      jittered_points = TRUE,position = position_points_jitter(height = 0),
                      point_shape = '|', point_size = 2, point_alpha = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  ylab("Impute method")+ ylab("Log2 value") + xlim(c(9,39))+
  theme_DEP1()
```



Left-censored approaches, like MinProb and GSimp replace MVs by conservatively low values; local similarity method "knn" and global data learning "RF" impute relatively larger values. .These two method cater to MNAR and MAR respectively. But "knn" will impute a mean value when the row contains more than 50% missing.


```{r rmtemp}
rm(list = c("norm_pg_sample", "imp_pg_knn","imp_pg_MinProb","imp_pg_RF","imp_pg_GSimp"))
## Impute missing data using q-th quantile for following analysis
imp_pg <- impute(norm_pg, fun = "MinDet" ,q = 0.01)
```



**Hypothesis test**

Function `test_diff` perform a moderated t-test from limma. In DEP, p values is corrected by the `fdrtool` to classify significantly regulated/enriched candidates and stable proteins. DEP2 additionally provides two alternative frequently-used FDR control method, *"Benjamini-Hochberg fdr"* and *"Storey's qvalue"*.

```{r testdiff}
## Test every sample versus PBS control
diff_pg <- test_diff(imp_pg, type = "control", control = "PBS", fdr.type = "BH")
## Test on manul contrasts
diff_pg2 <- test_diff(imp_pg, type = "manual", test  = c("W4_vs_PBS"), fdr.type = "Storey's qvalue")
```

Function `add_rejections` can classify significant hits according L2FC (*lfc*) and adjusted p value (*alpha*) threshold.

```{r rejections1}
## Add significant rejections for features, based on 
dep_pg <- add_rejections(diff_pg, alpha = 0.01, lfc = 2)
## get the significant subset
dep_pg_sig <- get_signicant(dep_pg)
nrow(dep_pg_sig)
```

Use the `plot_volcano` to have a quick look on result.

```{r rejections plot 1}
### volcano plot on contrast "W4_vs_PBS"
plot_volcano(dep_pg, contrast = "W4_vs_PBS", adjusted = F)
## plot the cutoff line
plot_volcano(dep_pg, contrast = "W4_vs_PBS", adjusted = F,
             add_threshold_line = "intersect", pCutoff  = 0.05, fcCutoff = 1)
```

Besides the intersect method, add_rejections can draw a curve cutoff approach described by [Eva C.Keilhauer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620316674). Instead of intersect straight lines, the approach used curve lines with $y > c/(x - x_0)$, where $x$ is the log2 FC, $y$ is adjusted P value of features (*c* = curvature, *x[0]* = minimum L2FC). We use the standard deviation $\sigma$ determine x0 by $x_0 = x_0.fold*\sigma$. $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian curve distribution of log2 FC in each contrast.

```{r rejections2,fig.height=7}
## thresholdmethod = "curve"
dep_pg_curve <- add_rejections(diff_pg, thresholdmethod = "curve", curvature  = 2, x0_fold = 2)

## the cutoff line on volcano
plot_volcano(dep_pg_curve, contrast = "W4_vs_PBS", add_threshold_line = "curve", curvature = 2, x0_fold = 2) /
  plot_volcano(dep_pg_curve, contrast = "W6_vs_PBS", add_threshold_line = "curve", curvature = 2, x0_fold = 2)

```

You can check the $\sigma$ and fitted Gaussian curve by `plot_diff_hist`.

```{r}
## Check the fitted Gaussian curve
plot_diff_hist(dep_pg_curve, contrasts = c("W4_vs_PBS", "W6_vs_PBS"))

## Get the fit result 
plot_diff_hist(dep_pg_curve, plot = F) ## a table of gaussian args \sigma and \mu
```

`plot_heatmap` can plot a heatmap for significant candidates.

```{r heatmap,collapse=T}
plot_heatmap(dep_pg)

## Reorder columns by condition
dep_pg = DEP2::Order_cols(dep_pg,order = c("PBS","W2","W4","W6","W9","W10"))
plot_heatmap(dep_pg, cluster_columns = F, kmeans = T, k = 5, seed = 1) # cluster features

## Only plot the clusters that are up-regulated in treatment groups.
plot_heatmap(dep_pg, cluster_columns = F, kmeans = T, k = 5, seed = 1, col_limit = 4,
             split_order = c(1,2,5)
             )
## plot on select contrast
plot_heatmap(dep_pg, manual_contrast = "W4_vs_PBS")
```

## Analysis based on protein re-aggregation

The second pipeline is aggregation protein abundance from peptide quantity data. The analysis workflow is different to last one in data processing steps.

![](figs/DEP2workflow2.png "Fig. 2 the pipeline for protein re-aggregation")

**Filter**

QFeatures object can be filtered though by `filter_pe`. Its usage is similar to function `filter_se`, could filter out unexpected features by missing ratio or based on identification information in certain rowdata columns.

<!-- ```{r filter pe,include=F,eval=FALSE} -->

<!-- ## Sample 800 protein ID as example, to reduce computational cost in these vignette -->

<!-- set.seed(50) -->

<!-- pe_peptides -->

<!-- sample_protein = sample(unique(Silicosis_peptide$Proteins),1000) -->

<!-- pe_peptides2 <- filter_pe(pe_peptides, filter_formula = ~ Proteins %in% sample_protein) -->

<!-- pe_peptides2 -->

<!-- ## fitlt out low quality peptides -->

<!-- filt_pe <- filter_pe(pe_peptides2, thr = 1,fraction = 0.4, filter_formula = ~ Reverse != '+' & Potential.contaminant !="+" ) -->

<!-- ``` -->

```{r filter pe}
filt_pe <- filter_pe(pe_peptides, 
                     thr = 1,fraction = 0.4,  ## filter based on missing values
                     filter_formula = ~ Reverse != '+' & Potential.contaminant !="+" )
```

**imputation**

Imputation could perform before normalization, to reduce the potential effect of MVs to normalization.

```{r imp pe, message=FALSE}
## Use QFeatures::addAssay() and DEP2::impute
pe <- QFeatures::addAssay(filt_pe,
                              DEP2::impute(filt_pe[["peptideRaw"]], fun = "QRILC"), 
                              name = "peptideImp")
plot_imputation(pe[["peptideRaw"]], pe[["peptideImp"]])
```

**Normalization**

Function `normalize_pe` perform normalize and call `QFeatures:normalize`. Four normalization methods are selectable., including *"diff.median", "quantiles", "quantiles.robust" ,"vsn"*. Notice that *quantiles.robust* can't handle data table with missing (ie NA). Therefore It is necessary to Imputate in advance .

```{r imp before norm2}
pe <- DEP2:::normalize_pe(pe,method = "quantiles.robust",
                               i = "peptideImp",    ## nomalize on which assay
                               name = "peptideNorm" ## output assay name
                               )

plot_normalization(pe[["peptideRaw"]],pe[["peptideImp"]],pe[["peptideNorm"]])

```

**Aggregation**

DEP2 packaged function `aggregate_pe` based on `QFeatures::aggregateFeatures`. The summarisation approach *aggrefun* can be "RobustSummary" (also called MSqRobSum) [@Sticker:2020], "medianPolish", "totalMean". Details can see `?aggregateFeatures`. And proteingroups can be summed by "Unique + Razor" or "Unique".

```{r aggrega}
begin_time = Sys.time()
pe <- DEP2::aggregate_pe(pe,
                         aggrefun = "RobustSummary",
                         aggregate_Peptide_Type = "Unique + Razor",
                         fcol = "Proteins",                  # the protein ID column in input table
                         peptide_assay_name = "peptideNorm", # the assay to aggregate
                         reserve = "Gene.names"              # reserve the Gene.names in row data.
)

print(Sys.time() - begin_time)

pe # protein result is in the protein assay
se_pep <- pe2se(pe, names = "Gene.names", ids = "smallestProteingroups")
```

**Differential test** Following differential test is same to the proteingroups pipeline. Use `test_diff` and `add_rejections` to classify significant protein.

```{r}
## Differential test
diff_pep <- DEP2::test_diff(se_pep,type = "control", control = "PBS", fdr.type = "BH")
## Add rejections
dep_pep <- add_rejections(diff_pep,alpha = 0.01, lfc = 2)
get_signicant(dep_pep) %>% nrow
```

Data visualization functions is also worked for DEP results from re-aggregation.

```{r DEP visualization}
## Volcano
plot_volcano(dep_pep, contrast = "W4_vs_PBS", add_threshold_line = "intersect") 
## Heatmap
plot_heatmap(dep_pep, kmeans = T,k = 5,col_limit = 6) 
```

## Analysis for PTM-specific proteomics

The third pipeline is analysis PTM-specific proteomics. It accept the quantification result table of modified sites. Data processing workflow is basically similar to the PG analysis workflow. After make_unique_PTM

**Filter** 

`filter_se` are universal function for SE object. For PTM studies, an additional analysis on

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Filter base on both missing occupancy and the localization probability for this site.
filt_ptm <- filter_se(se_ptm, 
                      thr = 1, fraction = 0.3, 
                      filter_formula = ~ Reverse!="+" & Potential.contaminant!="+"&Localization.prob>0.7)

norm_ptm <- normalize_vsn(filt_ptm)

imp_ptm <- impute(filt_ptm, fun= "knn")

diff_ptm <- test_diff(imp_ptm, type = "manual", test = "PBS_vs_W6" , fdr.type = "BH")

dep_ptm <- DEP2::add_rejections(diff_ptm, alpha = 0.05, lfc = 1)
plot_volcano(dep_ptm,adjusted = T, add_threshold_line = "intersect")
```

## Export result table

Function `get_results` can get the result table from DEP2 and *limma*.

```{r table1}
## Get result table
DT::datatable(head(get_results(dep_pg)), options = list(scrollX = T,pageLength = 5))
```

Function `get_df_wide` can get the full data table from a dep result.

```{r table2}
## Get full data set with row information.
DT::datatable(head(get_df_wide(dep_pg)), options = list(scrollX = T,pageLength = 5))
```

Function `get_df_wide` can get results of significant candidates.

```{r table3}
## Get full data set of significant features
get_signicant(dep_pg,return_type = "table") %>% select(ends_with("significant")) %>% summary
```

## Result comparation

`plot_multi_venn` and `plot_multi_heatmap` can directly compare the significant result from two omics experiments via name identifiers.

Use `plot_multi_venn` to compare the differentce between two pipelines (analysis from MQ proteingroups or the peptides re-aggregation pipeline).

```{r comparation}
## Test on the contrast W4_vs_PBS.
diff_pg <- test_diff(imp_pg, type = "manual", test  = c("W4_vs_PBS"), fdr.type = "Storey's qvalue")
dep_pg <- diff_pg %>% add_rejections(alpha = 0.05,lfc = 2)
diff_pep <- DEP2::test_diff(se_pep,type = "control", control = "PBS", fdr.type = "Storey's qvalue")
dep_pep <- add_rejections(diff_pep,alpha = 0.05, lfc =2)

## Filter out pg quantified by only one peptides.
dep_pep = filter_se(dep_pep,filter_formula = ~.n  > 2)
dep_pg = filter_se(dep_pg,filter_formula = ~Razor...unique.peptides  > 2)

## Plot Venn to explore the difference between two ways.
plot_multi_venn(omics_list = list(PG= dep_pg, pep=dep_pep))

## If set the proteins remained in both peptides as background. (the peptide is )
## dep_pep only contain two conditions of the study. PBS and W4. See the pe_peptides above.
overlap_protein = intersect(rownames(dep_pep), rownames(dep_pg))
plot_multi_venn(omics_list = list(PG= dep_pg, pep=dep_pep), background = overlap_protein)
```

Check the expression of interested proteins/genes accorss omics via `plot_multi_heatmap`.
Here we take some proteins may be related to IL-1 signaling, the signaling pathway that is reported to be upregulated in silicosis mouse model in the original paper.
```{r mulheatmap}
## Take some proteins may response to interleukin-1 as an example.
IL1_relative_genes <-c("Irg1", "Il1rn", "Saa3", "Zbp1", "Ccl6", 
                       "Serpine1", "Ccl21a", "Pycard", "Irak2", "Vrk2", 
                       "Fn1", "Il1r1", "Irf1", "Ccl9", "Mapk11", "Tank", 
                       "Mapk13")

## Order the samples by time.
dep_pg <- Order_cols(dep_pg, order = c("PBS","W2","W4","W6","W9","W10"))

## Plot the heatmap upon two DEP results.
plot_multi_heatmap(omics_list = list(PG= dep_pg, pep=dep_pep),
                   choose_name = IL1_relative_genes,
                   width = 4)
```

# Post analysis

To reduce the barriers in format conversion between deferential test and downstream analysis, post analysis suites for DEP results is available in DEP2.

## Biological function enrichment

Biological functional enrichment functions from `r Biocpkg("enrichR")`, `r Biocpkg("clusterProfiler")` and `r Biocpkg("ReactomePA")` are packaged in `test_ORA` and `test_GSEA` to perform over representation analysis or gene set enrichment analysis upon DEP result output from `test_diff` and `add_rejection`. Objective gene list is extracted. Then ID is transformed though organism annotation data, and further mapped biological knowledge annotated gene sets. `test_ORA` can perform enrichment analysis upon Gene ontology, KEGG or REACTOME data.

```{r enrichment, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diff_pg <- test_diff(imp_pg, type = "control", control  = c("PBS"), fdr.type = "Storey's qvalue")
dep_pg <- diff_pg %>% add_rejections(alpha = 0.01,lfc = 2)

check_enrichment_depends() # check required packages
require(org.Mm.eg.db) # organism annotation for mouse
require(clusterProfiler) # organism annotation for mouse

## Over representation analysis
# On one contrast
res_ora <- test_ORA(dep_pg, contrasts = "W4_vs_PBS", species = "Mouse",type = "GO")

class(res_ora)

# On each contrasts
res_ora2 <- test_ORA(dep_pg, by_contrast = T, species = "Mouse",type = "GO")

class(res_ora2)

## Gene set enrichment analysis
res_gsea <- DEP2::test_GSEA(dep_pg, by_contrast = F, species = "Mouse",type = "GO")

class(res_gsea)
```

`test_ORA` and `test_GSEA` return original result containers from functions, which is seamlessly compatible for plot functions and manipulate function provided for *enrichR* result. The visualization methods from `r Biocpkg("enrichplot")` package can seamlessly draw on output of these two output.

```{r dotplot}
library(enrichplot)

## Dotplot function from DOSE package
dotplot(res_ora)
```

```{r gesaplot}
## GSEA plot on one category
gseaplot(res_gsea,geneSetID = "GO:0071347")
```

**cnet** on interested biological process which enriched in GSEA.
```{r cnet}
## Cnetplot
res_gsea2 <- res_gsea %>% 
  filter(ID %in% c("GO:0071347","GO:0035329","GO:0032660","GO:0090263","GO:0035456","GO:0038061"))
cnetplot(res_gsea2,foldChange = res_gsea@geneList,node_label = "category",showCategory = 6)
```

## Expression pattern cluster

In the time-course omics studies or the experiments with complex group design, it's hard to dig up key candidates across entire experiment from cumbersome contrasts. DEP2 provides a `get_tc_cluster` function to perform timecourse cluster for omics data with multiple groups. It cluster all giving features by "cmeans", and return a list contains heatmap plot and cluster result.

```{r tcheatmap,fig.height=14}
## Perform cluster on signicant protein in all contrast
tc_pg <- get_tc_cluster(get_signicant(dep_pg),
               group_order = c("PBS","W2","W4","W6","W9","W10") # reset the group order
              )
## Time course heatmap
tc_pg$ht
```


```{r tcheatmap2}
## Expression cluster on phospholated sites
tc_ptm <- get_tc_cluster(get_signicant(dep_ptm),
                         group_order = c("PBS","W2","W4","W6","W9","W10"), # reset the group order
                         row_font_size = 0,
                         k = 8,
                         heatmap_height = 2
)
tc_ptm$ht
```

A cluster result table in store in the 'res' slot of output. It is a data.frame record the closest cluster, membership and expression values of each feature.
```{r tcres}
## The clustering result table
tc_ptm$res %>% head
```


## Protein-protein interaction

DEP2 provides a function `test_PPI` to construct protein-protein interaction network though STRING data. `test_PPI` perform PPI analysis locally and will download the species data from STRING.

```{r PPI1,warning=FALSE,eval=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# Check required packages for network construction.
check_PPI_depends()
# Load STRING data. If local STRING is missing, load_PPIdata will download to system.file("PPIdata", "Mouse",package = "DEP2")
load_PPIdata(speciesname = "Mouse") 

# Load STRING data and perform PPI analysis. If local STRING is missing, test_PPI will download to system.file("PPIdata",package = "DEP2")
PPI_res <- test_PPI(
  dep_pg,
  contrasts = "W4_vs_PBS",
  species = "Mouse",
  STRING.version = "11.5",
  score_cutoff = 400
)

# igraph network
PPI_ig <- PPInetwork(PPI_res,returntype = "igraph")
igraph::plot.igraph(PPI_ig)

```

```{r PPI2,eval=FALSE,fig.height=8}
## visNetwork network
PPInetwork(PPI_res,returntype = "visNetwork") 
```
